# A-website
a simple website for some service
============ first issue: position:absolute; ============
it works for me.
but I wonder, is it right way to position elements?

============ second issue: font-size:...vw; ============
Is there anyway to use percentages with font size instead of vw?
I want font to be fixed when I change the screen size.
